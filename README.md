GoPro Lens Correction Profiles for Hugin
I made three correction profiles for Hugin, because the params that my GoPro  Hero 3+ puts on EXIF doesnt match well. So for now we have three profiles:

These are all for GoPro Hero 3+ Silver. Let me know if work fine for other camera models! :D
If not, send me a picture of the checkerboard.jpg took with your GoPro, and the GoPro Model. I will make a profile for you.

*	GoPro Hero3+  1080p wide.ini - Used for 1080p Wide Screenshots from Video Recording
*	GoPro Hero3+  Medium.ini 	 - Used for 7MP Medium Pictures 
*	GoPro Hero 3+ Wide.ini 		 - Used for 10MP Wide Pictures

Just load it on Hugin as Lens Profile from INI. See Examples folder to see original and corrected images.
